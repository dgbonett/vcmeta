Implements functions for varying coefficient meta-analysis methods.
These methods do not assume effect size homogeneity. Subgroup effect
size comparisons, general linear effect size contrasts, and linear
models of effect sizes based on varying coefficient methods can be used
to describe effect size heterogeneity. Varying coefficient meta-analysis
methods do not require the unrealistic assumptions of the traditional
fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis methods.
