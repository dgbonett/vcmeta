}
\value{
A 4-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 summarizes the original study
\item Row 2 summarizes the follow-up study
\item Row 3 estimates the difference in standardized mean differences
\item Row 4 estimates the average standardized mean difference
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - standardized mean difference estimate (single study, difference, average)
\item SE - standard error
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
This function computes confidence intervals from an original study and a follow-up
study where the effect size is a paired-samples standardized mean difference.
Confidence intervals for the difference and average effect size are also computed.
Equality of variances within or across studies is not assumed. The same results
can be obtained using the \link[vcmeta]{meta.lc.stdmean.ps} function with
appropriate contrast coefficients. The confidence level for the difference is
1 â€“ 2*alpha, which is recommended for equivalence testing. Square root unweighted
variances and single-condition standard deviation are options for the standardizer.
