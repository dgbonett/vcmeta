\title{Compares and combines single mean in original and follow-up studies}
\usage{
replicate.mean1(alpha, m1, sd1, n1, m2, sd2, n2)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{m1}{estimated mean in original study}

\item{sd1}{estimated SD in original study}

\item{n1}{sample size in original study}

\item{m2}{estimated mean in follow-up study}

\item{sd2}{estimated SD in follow-up study}

\item{n2}{sample size for in follow-up study}
}
\value{
A 4-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 summarizes the original study
\item Row 2 summarizes the follow-up study
\item Row 3 estimates the difference in means
\item Row 4 estimates the average mean
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - mean estimate (single study, difference, average)
\item SE - standard error
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
\item df - degrees of freedom
}
}
\description{
This function computes confidence intervals for a single mean from an
original study and a follow-up study. Confidence intervals for the
difference between the two means and average of the two means are also
computed. Equality of variances across studies is not assumed. A
Satterthwaite adjustment to the degrees of freedom is used to improve
the accuracy of the confidence intervals for the difference and average.
The confidence level for the difference is 1 â€“ 2*alpha, which is
recommended for equivalence testing.
