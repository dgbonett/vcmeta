\title{Computes a Pearson correlation between paired measurements from a
paired-samples t statistic}
\usage{
cor.from.t(m1, m2, sd1, sd2, t, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{estimated mean for measurement 1}

\item{m2}{estimated mean for measurement 2}

\item{sd1}{estimated standard deviation for measurement 1}

\item{sd2}{estimated standard deviation for measurement 2}

\item{t}{value of paired-samples t-test}

\item{n}{sample size}
}
\value{
Returns the sample Pearson correlation between the two paired measurements
}
\description{
Computes the Pearson correlation between paired measurements
using a reported paired-samples t statistic and other
sample information. This correlation estimate is needed
in several functions that analyze mean differences and
standardized mean differences in paired-samples studies.

cor.from.t(9.4, 9.8, 1.26, 1.40, 2.27, 30)

# Should return:
#                Estimate
# Correlation:  0.7415209
