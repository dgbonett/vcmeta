\title{Compares and combines single proportion in original and follow-up studies}
\usage{
replicate.prop1(alpha, f1, n1, f2, n2)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{f1}{frequency count in original study}

\item{n1}{sample size in original study}

\item{f2}{frequency count in follow-up study}

\item{n2}{sample size for in follow-up study}
}
\value{
A 4-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 summarizes the original study
\item Row 2 summarizes the follow-up study
\item Row 3 estimates the difference in proportions
\item Row 4 estimates the average proportion
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - proportion estimate (single study, difference, average)
\item SE - standard error
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
This function computes confidence intervals for a single proportion from an
original study and a follow-up study. Confidence intervals for the
difference between the two proportions and average of the two proportions
are also computed. The same results can be obtained using the \link[vcmeta]{meta.lc.prop1}
function with appropriate contrast coefficients. The confidence level for the
difference is 1 â€“ 2*alpha, which is recommended for equivalence testing.
