\title{Compares and combines 2-group proportion differences in original and
follow-up studies}
\usage{
replicate.prop2(alpha, f11, f12, n11, n12, f21, f22, n21, n22)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{alpha level for 1-alpha confidence}

\item{f11}{frequency count for group 1 in original study}

\item{f12}{frequency count for group 2 in original study}

\item{n11}{sample size for group 1 in original study}

\item{n12}{sample size for group 2 in original study}

\item{f21}{frequency count for group 1 in follow-up study}

\item{f22}{frequency count for group 2 in follow-up study}

\item{n21}{sample size for group 1 in follow-up study}

\item{n22}{sample size for group 2 in follow-up study}
}
\value{
A 4-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 summarizes the original study
\item Row 2 summarizes the follow-up study
\item Row 3 estimates the difference in proportion differences
\item Row 4 estimates the average proportion difference
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - proportion difference estimate (single study, difference, average)
\item SE - standard error
\item z - z-value
\item p - p-value
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
This function computes confidence intervals from an original study and a
follow-up study where the effect size is a 2-group proportion difference.
Confidence intervals for the difference and average effect size are also
computed. The same results can be obtained using the \link[vcmeta]{meta.lc.prop2}
function with appropriate contrast coefficients. The confidence level for
the difference is 1 â€“ 2*alpha, which is recommended for equivalence testing.
