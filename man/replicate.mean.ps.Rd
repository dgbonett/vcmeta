\value{
A 4-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 summarizes the original study
\item Row 2 summarizes the follow-up study
\item Row 3 estimates the difference in mean differences
\item Row 4 estimates the average mean difference
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - mean difference estimate (single study, difference, average)
\item SE - standard error
\item df - degrees of freedom
\item t - t-value
\item p - p-value
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
}
}
\description{
This function computes confidence intervals from an original study and a
follow-up study where the effect size is a paired-samples mean difference.
Confidence intervals for the difference and average effect size are also
computed. Equality of variances within or across studies is not assumed.
A Satterthwaite adjustment to the degrees of freedom is used to
improve the accuracy of the confidence intervals for the difference and
average. The confidence level for the difference is 1 â€“ 2*alpha, which is
recommended for equivalence testing.
