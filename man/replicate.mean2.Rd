\value{
A 4-row matrix. The rows are:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 summarizes the original study
\item Row 2 summarizes the follow-up study
\item Row 3 estimates the difference between studies
\item Row 4 estimates the average effect size for the two studies
}

The columns are:
\itemize{
\item Estimate - mean difference estimate (single study, difference, average)
\item SE - standard error
\item t - t-value
\item p - p-value
\item LL - lower limit of the confidence interval
\item UL - upper limit of the confidence interval
\item df - degrees of freedom
}
}
\description{
This function computes confidence intervals for a 2-group mean difference
from an original study and a follow-up study. Confidence intervals for the
difference and average effect size also are computed. A Satterthwaite
adjustment to the degrees of freedom is used to improve the accuracy of the
confidence intervals. The same results can be obtained using the \link[vcmeta]{meta.lc.mean2}
function with appropriate contrast coefficients. The confidence level for the
difference is 1 â€“ 2alpha.
