abstract = {When the distribution of the response variable is skewed, the population median may be a more meaningful measure of centrality than the population mean, and when the population distribution of the response variable has heavy tails, the sample median may be a more efficient estimator of centrality than the sample mean. The authors propose a confidence interval for a general linear function of population medians. Linear functions have many important special cases including pairwise comparisons, main effects, interaction effects, simple main effects, curvature, and slope. The confidence interval can be used to test 2-sided directional hypotheses and finite interval hypotheses. Sample size formulas are given for both interval estimation and hypothesis testing problems.},

abstract = {The additive hazards model is one of the most commonly used regression models in the analysis of failure time data and many methods have been developed for its inference under various situations. This paper discusses the situation where one faces current status data and also there exists informative censoring or when the failure time of interest and the observation process are correlated. Several authors have discussed the problem and in particular, Zhang et al. (2005) and Zhao et al. (2015) proposed an estimating equationbased approach and a copula model-based method, respectively. However, the former may not be efficient and the latter needs some restrictive assumptions. To address these, we propose a sieve maximum likelihood estimation approach that can be more efficient and also does not require the assumption above. For the implementation of the method, an EM algorithm is developed and the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators are established. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method works well in practical situations and an application is provided.},

abstract = {Most psychology journals now require authors to report a sample value of effect size along with hypothesis testing results. The sample effect size value can be misleading because it contains sampling error. Authors often incorrectly interpret the sample effect size as if it were the population effect size. A simple solution to this problem is to report a confidence interval for the population value of the effect size. Standardized linear contrasts of means are useful measures of effect size in a wide variety of research applications. New confidence intervals for standardized linear contrasts of means are developed and may be applied to between-subjects designs, within-subjects designs, or mixed designs. The proposed confidence interval methods are easy to compute, do not require equal population variances, and perform better than the currently available methods when the population variances are not equal. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {The conventional fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) confidence intervals that are used to assess the average alpha reliability across multiple studies have serious limitations. The FE method, which is based on a constant coefficient model, assumes equal reliability coefficients across studies and breaks down under minor violations of this assumption. The RE method, which is based on a random coefficient model, assumes that the selected studies are a random sample from a normally distributed superpopulation. The RE method performs poorly in typical meta-analytic applications where the studies have not been randomly sampled from a normally distributed superpopulation or have been randomly sampled from a nonnormal superpopulation. A new confidence interval for the average reliability coefficient of a specific measurement scale is based on a varying coefficient statistical model and is shown to perform well under realistic conditions of reliability heterogeneity and nonrandom sampling of studies. New methods are proposed for assessing reliability moderator effects. The proposed methods are especially useful in meta-analyses that involve a small number of carefully selected studies for the purpose of obtaining a more accurate reliability estimate or to detect factors that moderate the reliability of a scale. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

Two types of statistical replication evidence and four types of statistical nonreplication evidence are described. In addition, three types of inconclusive statistical replication evidence are described. An important benefit of a replication study is the ability to combine an effect-size estimate from the original study with an effect-size estimate from the follow-up study to obtain a more precise and generalizable effect-size estimate. The sample size in the follow-up study is an important design consideration, and some methods for determining the follow-up sample size requirements are discussed.
